### Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on Facelime - collage app with your face and also on work project - Mental growth team.

🌱 I’m currently learning programming architecture, patterns and product management. My development tech stack includes JavaScript, Typescript, React.js, React Native, Node.js, Next.js, Google Cloud Platform - that includes Firebase, Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, Cloud SQL, Cloud Storage and GSuite.

🏢 I have developed [Facelime](https://facelime.com) (collage photo editor), Food Hunter food delivery platform ([admin](https://codecanyon.net/item/food-delivery-admin-panel-food-hunter/31245325) + [mobile app](https://codecanyon.net/item/food-delivery-mobile-app-with-react-firebase-food-hunter/32994326)), [Wallpaled](https://wallpaled.com) (mobile wallpapers app).

✍️ I author [technology blog](https://vladimirevstratov.ru/blog/) where I publish how-to guides and tutorials around consumer software and apps.
